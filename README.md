Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial planning consulting firm aiming to modernize its operations through the utilization of tailored software solutions.
As an integral aspect of this modernization endeavor, Artemis Financial places significant emphasis on software security to safeguard sensitive financial information and uphold the reliability and confidentiality of its services.
I, as a developer at Global Rain, have been assigned the responsibility of offering specialized insights into securing Artemis Financial's RESTful web application programming interface (API) against external vulnerabilities.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I was able to identify the outdated software APIs that were causing the vulnerabilities in the system and the code base. I was also able to find the most updated APIs to use to remedy the vulnerabilities and get rid of those
from the code base provided. Secure coding practices help safeguard sensitive data such as customer information, financial records, and intellectual property from unauthorized access, theft, or manipulation. 
This protection is essential for maintaining customer trust and complying with data protection regulations. A security breach can tarnish a company's reputation and erode customer confidence. 
Secure coding helps prevent data breaches, which in turn preserves the company's reputation and brand image in the market.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One of the most challenging aspects is identifying all potential vulnerabilities within the system or application. This requires a thorough understanding of the technology stack, architecture, and potential attack vectors. 
However, this process is also helpful as it sheds light on weaknesses that need to be addressed to improve overall security posture.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I made sure that all the hardware was up to date and all software is updated to increase the layers of security. Implementing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), 
and secure gateway devices to control and monitor traffic entering and leaving the network. Enforcing strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication), role-based access control (RBAC), 
and least privilege principles to restrict access to sensitive data and resources.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I would make sure by running the code in the IDE and checking for any vulnerabilities that came up while the code ran. I would conduct thorough code reviews with peers or security experts to identify any potential security vulnerabilities introduced during the refactoring process. 
Code reviews help ensure that the code adheres to best practices, security guidelines, and industry standards.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I can utilize version control systems such as Git to manage and track changes to your codebase effectively. 
Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket provide additional collaboration features and facilitate teamwork. Use IDEs like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or 
PyCharm to enhance productivity, streamline development workflows, and provide advanced code editing features, debugging tools, and project management capabilities.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I can show emplyers the refactored code that I did on this assignment to get rid of security vulnerabilites that were present on the original code base. I can also show them how I was able
to create SHA hash tokens to integrate security layers onto the codebase and software and make sure specific users were only using the software and accessing the data as well.
